#Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub page! In short, I'm a freelance smart contract engineer with experience in Solidity, Vyper, Foundry, ApeWorX, etc. ;)

I'm a huge fan of Web3 / DApp development, but also blockchain technology in general. I truly believe the third iteration of the World Wide Web is here to change the world for the better. I really love the Web3 / DApp development community in general, thanks to everbody who's a part of it! :)

Well, please feel free to check out my GitHub profile!

Read more... Soon!
