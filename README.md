# Hello World

Welcome to my GitHub!

## About Me

My name is Casper Kj√¶r Rasmussen (a.k.a. ckryptoon) and I live in Aalborg, Denmark, where I've lived for the most part of my life. My greatest passion in life has always been computer science in general. Ever since my parents bought me my first personal computer in the middle of the 1990s, which was perhaps a couple of years after I started going to school, I've been spending a lot of my time tinkering with computer technology. In general, I was and still am very excited about almost all areas of computer science. However, programming is probably my favourite area, if I had to pick one. I really love the art of programming and I've been learning and experimenting with different languages for specific purposes, projects, etc. I also have a lot of experience in other areas of computer science, but I won't go into detail with all of that right here, because this GitHub was created to focus on smart contract engineering for the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which is my primary area of interest today. In short, I simply believe that blockchain technology and the third iteration of the World Wide Web is not only here to stay, but also to change the world and our lives for the better in many ways. So, that's why I recently dedicated all my time to smart contract engineering, which is the skill you'll need if you want to develop decentralized applications for Web3. It also takes a lot of time to keep getting updated on this technology, as everything in the cryptosphere moves way quicker relative to the rest of the world. So, my goal is to make a career in smart contract engineering in order to be a part what's most likely going to change the world forever.

## Experience

## Thanks

Thank you for reading my personal GitHub profile. I hope you'll check out my repositories, although there are only a few right now, my plan is to upload many more in the near future. That's all for now, have a nice day! :)
